"Imagine this website as your link to the school print genie! üßû‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Students, you can easily sign up and share your documents with the admin. Just provide your document's title and a Google Drive link (for smooth website performance).

Now, here's the magic part: All these documents line up on the admin's desk. The admin prints them one by one and, poof, they disappear from the list. It's like a secret signal to know if your document has been printed.

Don't worry about your privacy. Your page is locked tight, and only you can access it. The admin can view and edit your documents but nothing else. To get into the admin's lair, simply use the username 'Admin' and the password 'secret_password.' ‚ú®"
